> _Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad._

> _Code is the tool. The program is the product._

> _Software performance is not about how many features you complete or how much code you type. It’s about how much value you create._

> _A good API is not just easy to use but also hard to misuse._

> _Don’t write code for something that isn’t actually required, yet. (You Aren’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI))_
