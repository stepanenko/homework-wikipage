> Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. --ROBERT C. MARTIN

> The most important property of a program is whether it accomplishes the intention of its user. --C. A. R. HOARE

> Another effective technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed “Never mind, I see what's wrong.
