### [The Difference Between Junior and Senior](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-is-the-difference-between-a-junior-and-a-senior-developer-63c1594d7a98)

..Eventually, you get hired as a senior developer not because you have
exceptional skills or knowledge as a developer, but because employers
would feel silly saying you’re not senior after you’ve invested so many years.

If you’ve been coding for more than 3 years and you’re not yet considered senior,
you may be missing a secret that separates average developers
from [10x developers](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/getting-to-10x-results-what-any-developer-can-learn-from-the-best-54b6c296a5ef).

That doesn’t mean write 10x more code, but instead write code that produces 10x more value:
10x more sales or 1/10th as many support requests because there are fewer critical bugs.
Software performance is not about how many features you complete or how much code you type.
It’s about how much value you create.

No matter how you measure performance, the potential benefit for you is that
you can earn 2x — 3x more if you master the right skills early in your career.

Soft skills matter. Empathetic developers write better software. They’re also easier to get along with because they’re conscious of the needs of the people around them, less self-centered, and less egotistical.
