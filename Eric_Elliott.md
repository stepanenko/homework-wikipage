### [The Difference Between Junior and Senior](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-is-the-difference-between-a-junior-and-a-senior-developer-63c1594d7a98)

..Eventually, you get hired as a senior developer not because you have
exceptional skills or knowledge as a developer, but because employers
would feel silly saying you’re not senior after you’ve invested so many years.

If you’ve been coding for more than 3 years and you’re not yet considered senior,
you may be missing a secret that separates average developers
from [10x developers](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/getting-to-10x-results-what-any-developer-can-learn-from-the-best-54b6c296a5ef).

That doesn’t mean write 10x more code, but instead write code that produces 10x more value:
10x more sales or 1/10th as many support requests because there are fewer critical bugs.
Software performance is not about how many features you complete or how much code you type.
It’s about how much value you create.

No matter how you measure performance, the potential benefit for you is that
you can earn 2x — 3x more if you master the right skills early in your career.

### What Should You Study?

- [Learn current syntax](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/a-functional-programmers-introduction-to-javascript-composing-software-d670d14ede30)

- [Learn to compose software](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/composing-software-the-book-f31c77fc3ddc)

All software development is composition: The act of breaking down big, complex problems into lots of smaller, easier-to-solve problems, and then composing those solutions to form the application. That’s why building blocks like functions, modules, objects, and classes exist: to compose.

- [Learn functional programming basics](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)

Functional programming’s focus on simple, composable building blocks and immutable state makes it an excellent fit for today’s web application architectures. It also tends to be more reusable, more flexible, and easier to refactor than procedural or object-heavy code. Almost all of JavaScript’s most popular libraries are functional, or inspired by functional approaches (e.g., React, Redux, Lodash, Ramda, RxJS, etc).

- Learn how to work with objects

OOP isn’t going away any time soon, and you don’t have to abandon OOP to program in a functional style. Objects and encapsulation will continue to have their place. Learn aggregation, delegation, concatenation, and encapsulation. Class inheritance has not been able to keep up with more modular code reuse patterns, such as module imports and simple functions. It’s best to favor compositional reuse patterns over class inheritance whenever possible. To get started, stop using the extends keyword and ask yourself if you can share and import functions from a module, instead.

- [Learn how to work with asynchronous processes](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261)

If we want to avoid timing dependency problems, there are many approaches, and some are better than others. Tools like promises and async/await will help. It may also be a good idea to learn how to work with streaming tools such as RxJS.

- Soft skills

Empathetic developers write better software. They’re also easier to get along with because they’re conscious of the needs of the people around them, less self-centered, and less egotistical.

### Quotes:

> As you strip constructors and classical inheritance out of JavaScript, it: Gets simpler. Gets more flexible. Gets more powerful & expressive

> Software performance is not about how many features you complete or how much code you type. It’s about how much value you create.

> If you want to learn something quickly, you can’t have your attention scattered everywhere except where you need it. Pick one language (start with JavaScript), one framework (start with React), one book, one course, one topic, etc. Whatever you pick, focus on that one thing until you have a sufficient mastery of it before you move on to something else.
